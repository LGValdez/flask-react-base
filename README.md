# flask-react-base
Base for flask and react projects

This is intended to be a base for small projects implementing Flask and React.

## Backend
* Create a python virtual environment
```
python -m venv venv
```
* Activate your virtual environment
* Go to server folder and install dependencies from requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* Run the backend
```
python server.py
```
By default this runs on http://127.0.0.1:5000/

## Frontend
* Go to the client folder and install npm modules
```
npm install
```
* Run the frontend
```
npm start
```
By default this runs on http://127.0.0.1:3000/

### Just get creative from there!
